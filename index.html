            Hendrix College manages its local stray cat colony with a <abbr title="Trap-Neuter-Release">TNR</abbr> program,
            and provides them food and shelter at various points on campus. Here are a few of the Hendrix cats I've had
            the pleasure of meeting.

            <h3>Miel</h3>
            <p>
               Several years ago my mom and I met a kitten at the edge of the woods who came running when we asked
               if she was hungry. She rode home in my lap, and Miel has lived happily with us ever since.
               She loves to play, scratch, and sleep all around our house. Sometimes it seems like she can understand English&#x2026;
