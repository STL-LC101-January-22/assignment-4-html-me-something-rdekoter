         <h2>Hendrix College Kitties</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">
            Hendrix College manages its local stray cat colony with a <abbr title="Trap-Neuter-Release">TNR</abbr> program,
            and provides them food and shelter at various points on campus. Here are a few of the Hendrix cats I've had
            the pleasure of meeting.
         </p>
         <div id="oliver">
            <img src="images/oliver.png" alt="Oliver, an orange tabby, sits upright on some mulch">
            <h3>Oliver</h3>
            <p>
               Having sired several litters before the college's management program was instituted, Oliver is "grandfathered in"
               at Hendrix in more ways than one. He can be found near the library on the North end of campus, enjoying sunlight
               and lots of pets. He may look like a lion, but his texture and demeanor are like a worn stuffed animal.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div id="ella">
            <img src="images/ella.png" alt="Ella, a black and pale orange tabby with white paws, reclines on a low wall">
            <h3>Ella</h3>
            <p>
               One of Oliver's older children, Ella is the "big sister" of the Hendrix cat colony. Having clearly inherited
               her father's friendliness, she lives near the center of campus to get petting from students between classes.
               She loves catnip and warm laps.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div id="daryl">
            <img src="images/daryl.png" alt="Daryl, a gray tabby with white sides, stomach, and legs, lies at the base of a brick wall">
            <h3>Daryl</h3>
            <p>
               Daryl is the other patriarch of the campus cats. He's a bit more shy than Oliver and Ella, but will warm up to you
               given time (and treats). Daryl resides near a residence hall on the Southern side of campus with Timothy, one of his
               children, who's even whiter and meeker than him. Though the two have had issues with the local raccoons, Daryl takes
               good care of his son.

            <h3>Miel</h3>
            <p>
               Several years ago my mom and I met a kitten at the edge of the woods who came running when we asked
               if she was hungry. She rode home in my lap, and Miel has lived happily with us ever since.
               She loves to play, scratch, and sleep all around our house. Sometimes it seems like she can understand English&#x2026;
